### Remarks
When one or more valid methods
with this attribute are found in a compilation, the compiler will
emit a module initializer which calls each of the attributed methods.

Certain requirements are imposed on any method targeted with this attribute:
- The method must be `static`.
- The method must be an ordinary member method, as opposed to a property accessor, constructor, local function, etc.
- The method must be parameterless.
- The method must return `void`.
- The method must not be generic or be contained in a generic type.
- The method's effective accessibility must be `internal` or `public`.
